A Comparison of different predictors to approximate the power of Convolutional Neural Networks like E2epp [[ResearchGate]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334008396_Surrogate-Assisted_Evolutionary_Deep_Learning_Using_an_End-to-End_Random_Forest-Based_Performance_Predictor), <!-- + Peephole [[arXiv]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03351) and a limited training [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01924). + -->

To do this comparison, we use a cartesian genetic algorithm to design Convolutional Neural Networks based on the paper: "A Genetic Programming Approach to Designing Convolutional Neural Network Architectures" [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00764).
